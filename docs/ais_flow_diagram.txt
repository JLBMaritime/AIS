AIS Data Flow Diagram

This is a text description of the AIS data flow that should be represented in an image:

[AIS Signal] --> [dAISy HAT] --> [Raspberry Pi] --> [Network] --> [Target Device]

                                                             or Chart Plotter

Key Components:
1. AIS Signal: Radio signals from ships containing vessel information
2. dAISy HAT: Hardware that receives and decodes AIS signals
3. Raspberry Pi: Runs the AIS server software
4. Network: WiFi or Ethernet connection
5. Target Device: Computer, chart plotter, or other device that processes AIS data
